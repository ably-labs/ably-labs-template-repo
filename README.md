# Ably Labs Template Repo

---

// This is a template repository to be used for all Ably Labs demos, tools &amp; proof of concepts. Follow these steps to so this repo is easy to use for visitors & maintainers.

1. Update the [.gitignore](.gitignore) file with one of the [standard templates from GitHub](https://github.com/github/gitignore).
1. Update [dependabot.yml](.github/dependabot.yml) with the  [configuration for your project](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates).
1. Replace `REPO_NAME` with the actual name of the repo in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

1. Add a GitHub workflow to build/test/deploy your application. Consider using the [Ably Control API GitHub action](https://github.com/ably-labs/ably-control-api-action) to avoid creating Ably apps/API keys manually.
